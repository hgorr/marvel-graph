# marvel-graph
Code to create a network graph for visualizing connections in the Marvel cinematic universe (including Avengers: Endgame.. sorry if spoilers!). The movie data are read through the OMDb API and the lists of characters are read and parsed from IMDb. 

Graph of the main characters (and my favorites):

Graph of the universe (minus some extras like "Security Guard #2","Woman at Pool".. though I left "Yeah Spider Man Guy" since that's awesome):

A MATLAB Live Script is included to visualize network with different layouts, selected from a dropdown
